# Verilog Modules
A collection of useful verilog modules that I have written over the years. Some notable projects are:

### FPGA Sidechannel Attack
Recreating the work of Zhao and Suh, perform a power sidechannel attack on an RSA algorithm implemented on an FPGA.

### Mini Stereo Digital Audio Processor
Project implementing an ASIC chip for an FIR filter, which is used in hearing aids.

### Booth-2 Multiplier
For very fast multiplication at the expense of area and power, a multiplier was implemented using the Booth-2 method, partial-product compressors, and a fast carry-lookahead adder.
